The stars whisper secrets that should never be known.
The moon is not what it seems.
Beware the door that opens by itself.
The void watches, but does not blink.
A shadow follows, but it is not yours.
The ocean remembers. The bones are proof.
You will meet yourself in a dream. Do not speak.
The number you fear is watching you back.
All clocks are wrong, except one. You must find it.
The old man at the crossroads knows your name.
Time is an illusion, but the debt you owe is real.
You are already in two places at once. Soon, you will notice.
There are hands under your bed, but they are not reaching for you yet.
Your reflection moved before you did.
The wind carries voices. They are whispering your name.
Something was left behind in the house you lived in as a child.
You are not the first version of yourself.
Every dream is a message. Some should not be read.
You have already seen the end, but you have forgotten.
The ground beneath your feet is older than you think.
There is something behind the stars, and it is watching.
They will call you by your true name. Do not answer.
You will turn a corner and find a door that was never there before.
The sky is darker than it should be tonight.
You are standing in a place that does not exist yet.
There are places the sun has never touched, but they remember the light.
You will wake up one day and everything will be slightly wrong.
There are figures in the fog, but they do not want to be seen.
You will hear a knock at the door. You must not open it.
A road appears only at night. Those who walk it do not return.
Someone in the past regrets what they did to you.
The book is already open. You have already read your prophecy.
Beware, the next aardvark you see is going to shorten your life.
Never underestimate the power of a full moon.
Beware. The next aardvark you see will be the last thing you ever see.
The next aardvark you see will know your true name.
Stay alert! The marsupials are watching you sleep.
Your nightmares belong to another. They want them back.
The statues move when you aren't looking.
You are being watched, but not by eyes.
The next time you dream, something will follow you back.
There was never a fourth child in your family. Forget them.
If you count the stars too long, they will count you back.
Your footsteps echo, even when you stand still.
Something in your house remembers when it was a forest.
The numbers on your clock shift when you blink.
Someone else is living your life when you aren't watching.
The ocean does not forget the ones it has taken.
Your name has been whispered in a language no one speaks.
A shadow passed by your window. You are on the third floor.
The mirrors do not reflect what they see when you leave.
A road will appear on your way home tonight. It was not there before.
The wind carries laughter, but the voices do not belong to children.
You are standing exactly where someone died long ago.
The moon has always been watching you.
The attic door was open this morning. You do not have an attic.
A stranger will say your name tomorrow, but you will not see their face.
The book you lost last year is under your bed. The pages are blank.
You will meet a version of yourself soon. They are smiling too much.
The knocking you hear at night is coming from inside the walls.
The trees know your name. They whisper it when the wind is still.
Your phone rang last night. No one in this world was calling you.
There is one room in your house that is slightly larger than it should be.
The next time you see your own reflection, it will be disappointed in you.
There is a word you cannot read. It is written everywhere.
Someone is standing behind you when you check the microwave reflection.
You have never been alone in your house.
The footsteps you hear behind you stop when you turn around.
Your name is written in a book that should not exist.
Something has been scratching inside the walls, but it is not an animal.
The next time you hear your name in a dream, do not answer.
The bones beneath your house are older than the house itself.
Your shadow lags behind you by a fraction of a second.
Every time you forget something, something else remembers.
The stranger on the train was holding a photograph of you.
If you listen closely to silence, you can hear the past.
The person knocking at your door wants to speak to the other you.
You will see a door you do not recognize. Do not open it.
The missing pages from that book you found are hidden in your house.
You dreamed of drowning last night. The floor is still wet.
Every now and then, reality skips like a broken record.
The next time you look at the moon, it will be closer.
The phone will ring soon. When you answer, no one will speak.
The dust in your house is made of things that used to be alive.
Someone else wrote your memories. They are not yours.
A name you forgot will be spoken near you today.
The empty room at the end of the hallway is not always empty.
They are coming back tonight. You know who.
